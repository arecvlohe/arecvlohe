## About

I am self-taught through **[@freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp)** developer that enjoys using typed languages, currently TypeScript and Rust. I am based in Tulsa, OK but was born and raised in sunny St. Pete, FL. I am part of **[@nativesintech](https://github.com/nativesintech)**, an organization dedicated to supporting Natives in technology. I am a citizen of Muscogee (Creek) Nation, US, and Canada. "Likepvsce" means "sit down" in Muscogee, a greeting that roughly translates to "welcome". If you want to follow me around then check out my [links](https://linktr.ee/adamrecvlohe).
