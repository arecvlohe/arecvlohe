# Likepvsce! ðŸ‘‹

## About

I am a self-taught through @freeCodeCamp developer that enjoys using typed languages, currently TypeScript and Rust. I am based in Tulsa, OK but was born and raised in sunny St. Pete, FL. I am part of @nativesintech, an organization dedicated to supporting Natives in technology. I am a citizen of Muscogee (Creek) Nation, US, and Canada. "Likepvsce" means "sit down" in Muscogee, a greeting that roughly translates to "welcome".
