# Likepvsce! ðŸ‘‹

## About

I am a **[@freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp)** alumn that enjoys using typed languages. I live in historic Tulsa, OK but was born and raised in sunny St. Pete, FL. I am part of **[@nativesintech](https://github.com/nativesintech)**, an organization dedicated to supporting Native/Indigenous peoples in technology. I am son of Nokosvlke (Bear Clan) and a citizen of Tvlvhase Wvkokiye, Muscogee (Creek) Nation, US, and Canada. 

"Likepvsce" means "sit down" in Muscogee, a greeting that roughly translates to "welcome".
