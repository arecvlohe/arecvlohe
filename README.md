I am part of **[@nativesintech](https://github.com/nativesintech)**, an organization dedicated to supporting Natives in technology. I am a citizen of Tvlvhase Wvkokiye, Muscogee (Creek) Nation, US, and Canada. Also, I am son of Bear Clan, "Likepvsce" means "sit down" in Muscogee, a greeting that roughly translates to "welcome".
